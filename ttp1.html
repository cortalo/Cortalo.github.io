#Talks to Teachers on Psychology 
##And to Students on Some of Life's Ideals(1)


*这本书是朱光潜在《给青年人的十二封信》中**谈静**中提到的，本书的内容非常丰富，下面是书籍的第二部分 Talks to Students 中的开头部分。由于自己没有找到中文译本，只好读英文版。自己瞎写了一点翻译，放在了这里。如果翻译有错误（虽然一定很多），欢迎告诉我，反正可能我也懒得改了。*
###Chapter  Ⅰ   The Gospel of Relaxation

>I wish in the following hour to take certain psychological doctrines and show their practical applications to mental hygiene0to the hygiene of our American life more practicularly. Our people, especially in academic circles, are turning towards psychology nowadays with great expectations; and if psychology is to justify them it must be by showing fruits in the pædagogic and therapeutic lines.

我希望在接下来的几个小时中，来展示心理学的教义在心理卫生上的具体应用——尤其是对于美国人生活中的心理卫生。现在许多人，尤其是学术圈的一些人，开始转向研究心理学并且抱有很大的期望；很可能一定要展示出在教育学与治疗学下的研究果实才能证明他们的胜利。

>The reader may possibly have heard of a peculiar theory of the emotions, commonly referred to in psychological literature as the Lange-James theory. According to this theory, our emotions are mainly due to those stimulus of the exciting object or situtation. An emotion of fear, for example, or surprise, is not a direct effect of the object's presence on the mind, but an effect of that still earlier effect, the bodily commotion which the object suddenly excites; so that, were this bodily commotion suppressed, we should not *feel* fear as call the situation fearful; we should not feel surprise, but coldly recognize that the object was indeed astonishing. One enthusiast has even gone so far as to say that when we feel sorry it is because we weep, when we feel afraid it is because we run away, and not conversely. Some of you may perhaps be acquainted with the paradoxical formula. Now, whatever exaggeration may possibly lurk in this account of our emotions (and I doubt myself whether the exaggeration be very great), it is certain that the main core of it is true, and that the mere giving way to tears, for example, or to the outward expression of an anger-fit, will result for the moment in making the inner grief or anger more acutely felt. There is, accordingly, no better known or more generally useful precept in the moral training of youth, or in one's personal self-discipline, than that which which bids us pay primary attention to what we do and express, and not to care too much for what we feel. If we only check a cowardly impulse in time, for example; or if we only *don't* strike the blow or rip out with the complaining or insulting word that we shall regret as long as we live, our feeling themselves will presently be the calmer and better, with no particular guidance from us on their own account. Action seems to follow feeling, but really action and feeling go together; and by regulating the action, which is under the more direct control of the will, we can indirectly regulate the feeling, which is not.

读者很可能已经听到过一些关于情绪的理论，一般来说是Lange-James著作中的理论。根据他们的理论，情绪是因为一些令人exciting的东西或情况的出现，反映到一些身体器官产生波动。举个例子，害怕或者惊喜，并不是因为当前脑海中的事物而产生的，反而是之前的一些影响产生的效果，也就是一些东西刺激导致的体内的一种混乱。也就是说，假如这种身体的混乱被控制住了，我们就不应该对一些令人害怕的场景感到那么害怕，或者也不会感到那么惊喜，只是单纯地意识到眼前地这件事确实有点令人惊讶。一位更狂热的信徒甚至更极端地说，我们伤心是因为我们在哭泣，我们害怕是因为我们在逃离，而不是相反地因果关系。你们中的一些人可能对这种似是而非的法则感到有点熟悉。算了，不管我们对于情绪要谈到的一些一些事情有多么夸张（而我怀疑是不是太夸张了点），但是可以肯定核心还是正确的。再比方说哭或生气，也会导致本身感觉伤心或愤怒更加严重。因此，除了客观上不让我们对我们做的事情、表达的情绪给予首要关注，忽略掉我们的情绪，没有一种更好的广泛的方案可以用于青年人的心理引导，或者是自律练习。再举个例子，如果我们只是隔一段时间小心地考察一下自己地情绪，或者只是不正面冲击，不大喊大叫的抱怨或者辱骂，我们的心情不久就会平静下来，变得更好，而并不需要特殊的指导。行为看似跟随情绪，但实际上行为和情绪是同步的，所以通过调节行为，直接地使行为更加可控，我们就可以间接调节情绪。

>Thus the sovereign voluntary path to cheerfulness, if our spontaneous cheerfulness be lost, is to sit u cheerfully, to look round cheerfully, and to act and speak as if cheerfulness were already there. If such conduct does not make you soon feel cheerful, nothing else on that occasion can. So to feel brave, act as if we were brave, use all our will to that end, and a courage-fit will very likely replace the fit of fear. Again, in order to feel kindly towards a person to whom we have been inimical, the only way is more or less deliberately to smile. to make sympathetic inquiries, and to force ourselves to say genial things. One hearty laugh together will bring enemies into a closer communion of heart than hours spent on both sides in inward wrestling with the mental demon of uncharitable feeling. To wrestle with a bad feeling only pins our attention on it, and keeps it still fastened in the mind; whereas if we act as if from some better feeling, the old bad feeling soon folds its tent like an Arab and silently steals away.

所以如果失去了活力，最主动地使自己高兴起来的方式，就是兴致勃勃地坐直，兴致勃勃地看一看周围，说话、做事就像自己本身就已经鼓舞起来了一样。如果这种方式没有很快是你真的鼓舞起来的话，那么什么都帮不了你了。所以如果想要勇气，就假装勇气已经有了去行动，尽力假装直到自己很快真的有了勇气。如果想要对某个人友好点，唯一地方式就是就是多多少少地微笑，做一些同理地询问，强迫自己去说友好的话。发自内心地一起大笑会把敌人变成一个亲密的盟友。这比花几个小时对抗自己的敌意更有效。事实上，与负面情绪对抗只会是我们更关注到自己的负面情绪，反而使负面情绪更牢固。而如果我们假装自己心情已经好起来了去做一些事情，那么原来的负面情绪很快就会消失。

>The best manuals of religious devotion accordingly reiterate the maxim that we must let our feelings go and pay no regard to them whatever. In an admirable and widely successful little book called *The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life*, by Mrs. Hannah Whitall Smith, I find this lesson on almost every page. *Act* faithfully, and you really have faith, no matter how cold and even how dubious you may feel. "It is your purpose God looks at," writes Mrs. Smith, "not your feelings about that purpose; and your purpose, or will, is therefore the only thing you need attend to... Let your emotions come or let them go, just as God pleases, and make no account of them either way... They really have nothing to do with the matter. They are not the indicators of your spiritual state, but are merely the indicators of your temperament or of your present physical condition."

就像很多人都说，想要提高宗教忠诚，忽视自己的情绪是最好的教程。一本大获成功的书《基督徒快乐生活的秘诀》中几乎每一页都提到了这一点。坚定不移地这么做，那么你就会真的拥有信念，不论你可能多么不在乎或者怀疑。那本书地作者说“主在乎的是你的目标，而不是你对目标的感受。你只需要在乎的就是目标与意志，不要管那些情绪，主也很乐意这样，情绪真的不值一提。情绪不是对精神状态的反应，而只是对你的目前的身体状态，是否暴躁之类的反应”

>But you all know these facts already, so I need no longer press them on your attention. From our acts and from our attitudes ceaseless inpouring currents of sensation come, which help to determine from moment to moment what our inner states shall be--that is a fundamental law of psychology which I will therefore proceed do assume.

但是你们应该都已经直到这些了，所以我不用再反复强调了。我们将继续假定的心理学基础原理是，从我们的行为和态度中表现出的感受，可以帮助我们确定当下的内心状态。

>A Viennese neurologist of considerable reputation has recently written about the Binnenleben, as he terms it, or buried life of human beings. No doctor, this writer says, can get into really profitable relations with a nervous patient until he gets some sense of what the patient's Binnenleben is, of the sort of unuttered inner atmosphere in which his consciousness dwells alone with the secrets of its prison-house. This inner personal tone is what we can't communicate or describe articulately to others; but the wraith and ghost of it, so to speak, are often what our friends and intimates feel as our most characteristic quality. In the unhealthy-minded, apart from all sorts of old regrets, ambitions checked by shames and aspirations obstructed by timidities, it consists mainly of bodily discomforts not distinctly localized by the sufferer, but breeding a general self-mistrust and sense that things are not as they should be with him. Half the thirst for alcohol that exists in the world exists simply because alcohol acts as a temporary anæsthetic and effacer to all these morbid feelings that never ought to be in a human being at all. In the healthy-minded, on the contrary, there are no fears or shames to discover; and the sensations that pour in from the organism only help to swell the general vital sense of security and readiness for anything that may turn up.

一位颇有声望的维也纳神经科医生最近写了些关于Binnenleben的著作，或者叫被掩埋的生活。他写道，没人能真的搞懂并帮助神经科病人，除非他了解点这位病人的Binnenleben，形象地说就像是心中有一座监狱，里面有许多无法表达出的感情。我们从来都不把自己的这种内在的情绪、性格告诉别人。我们可能会与自己最亲密的人探讨到自己的内在性格，而他们可能会觉得这些内在性格非常独特甚至可怕。在不太健康的头脑中，除了许多过去的懊悔，可能还会存在雄心与羞愧、渴望与懦弱之间的矛盾，这造成了人们身体上的不适，这种不适不是苦难直接造成的，而是通常出于一种疑惑与对周围事物的不解。很有趣的是，世界上得有一半的酒精需求就是简单地因为酒精可以暂时麻醉人们，暂时消除这些本来就不应该存在于心中地病态情绪。与此相反，在健康的大脑中，不应该找到这些恐惧或者羞愧。正常的源自身体器官的感受仅仅帮助我们增强最重要的安全感或者预感。

>Consider, for example, the effects of a well-toned motor-apparatus, nervous and muscular, on our general personal selfconsciousness, the sense of elasticity and efficiency that results. They tell us that in Norway the life of the women has lately been entirely revolutionized by the new order of muscular feelings with which the use of the ski, or long snow-shoes, as a sport for both sexes, has made the women acquainted. Fifteen years ago the Norwegian women were even more than the women of other lands votaries of the old-fashioned ideal of femininity, 'the domestic angel,' the 'gentle and refining influence' sort of thing. Now these sedentary fireside tabby-cats of Norway have been trained, they say, by the snow-shoes into lithe and audacious creatures, for whom no night is too dark or height too giddy, and who are not only saying goodbye to the traditional feminine pallor and delicacy of constitution, but actually taking the lead in every educational and social reform. I cannot but think that the tennis and tramping and skating habits and the bicycle-craze which are so rapidly extending among our dear sisters and daughters in this country are going also to lead to a sounder and heartier moral tone, which will send its tonic breath through all our American life.

就像我们之前说的，行为可以改变情绪。一台良好的结实的神经和肌肉组成的装置，会带来很高的效率。有人说挪威女性最近巨大的变革是因为滑雪的普及。15年前，挪威的女性甚至比其它地方的人更赞同传统的女性观念，例如应当温柔体贴。而现在她们被滑雪训练得矫健灵活，再也不怕黑恐高。不但不再信服传统的对于女性的要求，而且还在教育、社会变革中起到了领导作用。我想现在像网球、滑冰等许多运动在女性中的快速普及扩张，也会继续滋润社会。

>I hope that here in America more and more the ideal of the well-trained and vigorous body will be maintained neck by neck with that of the well-trained and vigorous mind as the two coequal halves of the higher education for men and women alike. The strength of the British Empire lies in the strength of character of the individual Englishman, taken all alone by himself. And that strength, I am persuaded, is perennially nourished and kept up by nothing so much as by the national worship, in which all classes meet, of athletic outdoor life and sport.

我真诚地希望那些受到高教育地群体可以让头脑和体魄齐头并进。就像不列颠帝国的力量依旧存在于英国人的性格力量中。而我也相信，这种力量通过民族崇拜持续地被保持并滋养着人们，而这种英国的民族崇拜就是户外运动，强健体魄。

>I recollect, years ago, reading a certain work by an American doctor on hygiene and the laws of life and the type of future humanity. I have forgotten its author's name and its title, but I remember well an awful prophecy that it contained about the future of our muscular system. Human perfection, the writer said, means ability to cope with the environment; but the environment will more and more require mental power from us, and less and less will ask for bare brute strength. Wars will cease, machines will do all our heavy work, man will become more and more a mere director of nature's energies, and less and less an exerter of energy on his own account. So that, if the *homo sapiens* of the future can only digest his food and think, what need will he have of well-developed muscles at all? And why, pursued this writer, should we not even now be satisfied with a more delicate and intellectual type of beauty than that which pleased our ancestors? Nay, I have heard a fanciful friend make a still further advance in this 'new-man' direction. With our future food, he says, itself prepared in liquid form from the chemical elements of the atmosphere, pepsinated or half-digested in advance, and sucked up through a glass tube from a tin can, what need shall we have of teeth, or stomachs even? They may go, along with our muscles and our physical courage, while, challenging ever more and more our proper admiration, will grow the gigantic domes of our crania, arching over our spectacled eyes, and animating our flexible little lips to those floods of learned and ingenious talk which will constitute our most congenial occupation.

我回想起几年前，就读到过一位美国博士所著的关于保健学、人生法则以及未来人性将有的特点。我虽然忘了作者的名字和文章的标题，但是我还记得里面对于未来我们的肌肉系统的极为悲观的预测。那位作者写道，人类的发展意味着不断适应自然；但是自然将要求我们不断提高思维能力，而不太重视身体力量。战争将会停止，机器会代替我们来完成各种体力活，人们将成为自然力量的向导，而不再使用人类自身那微小的体力。未来的人类只要还有消化食物的力气，并且能够思考，那还要那些高度发达的肌肉做什么的？不仅如此，我还听到过一位更认同这种观点的朋友说，未来我们的食物做成营养液就行，我们连牙齿，胃都用不到了。他们甚至还能继续说，除了那些关于肌肉，刚勇的我们不再需要，我们会长出保护我们头颅的保护盖，还能护着我们本来就带了眼镜的眼镜，我们只需要动动灵活的嘴皮子，研究那些无尽精深学问，而这些就是未来最合人类口味的工作。


>I am sure that your flesh creeps at this apocalyptic vision. Mine certainly did so; and I cannot believe that our muscular vigor will ever be a superfluity. Even if the day ever dawns in which it will not be needed for fighting the old heavy battles against Nature, it will still always be needed to furnish the background of sanity, serenity, and cheerfulness to life, to give moral elasticity to our disposition, to round off the wiry edge of our fretfulness, and make us good-humored and easy of approach. Weakness is too apt to be what the doctors call irritable weakness. And that blessed internal peace and confidence, that acquiescentia in seipso, as Spinoza used to call it, that wells up from every part of the body of a muscularly well-trained human being, and soaks the indwelling soul of him with satisfaction, is, quite apart from every consideration of its mechanical utility, an element of spiritual hygiene of supreme significance.

我几乎确信你都快被这种恐怖的描述吓傻了，而我也一样；我从来不信肌肉会成为废品。即使在未来我们真的再也用不着和残酷的大自然对抗，肌肉力量依旧是必要的。它让我们可以神智健全，从容不迫，对生活充满激情，让我们的生活更富有弹性，不那么急躁，甚至让我们幽默，与人相处融洽。虚弱或许都不应该是那些医生口中的应激性脆弱。那些宝贵的内在平静和自信，Spinoza叫它seipo，会从那些体魄强健的人体内每一个部分喷涌而出，浸润他的灵魂让他心满意足。这与体魄的力学用途根本不一样，所以强健的体魄在心理卫生上非常、极其重要。

<p>我回想起几年前，就读到过一位美国博士所著的关于保健学、人生法则以及未来人性将有的特点。我虽然忘了作者的名字和文章的标题，但是我还记得里面对于未来我们的肌肉系统的极为悲观的预测。那位作者写道，人类的发展意味着不断适应自然；但是自然将要求我们不断提高思维能力，而不太重视身体力量。战争将会停止，机器会代替我们来完成各种体力活，人们将成为自然力量的向导，而不再使用人类自身那微小的体力。未来的人类只要还有消化食物的力气，并且能够思考，那还要那些高度发达的肌肉做什么的？不仅如此，我还听到过一位更认同这种观点的朋友说，未来我们的食物做成营养液就行，我们连牙齿，胃都用不到了。他们甚至还能继续说，除了那些关于肌肉，刚勇的我们不再需要，我们会长出保护我们头颅的保护盖，还能护着我们本来就带了眼镜的眼镜，我们只需要动动灵活的嘴皮子，研究那些无尽精深学问，而这些就是未来最合人类口味的工作。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am sure that your flesh creeps at this apocalyptic vision. Mine certainly did so; and I cannot believe that our muscular vigor will ever be a superfluity. Even if the day ever dawns in which it will not be needed for fighting the old heavy battles against Nature, it will still always be needed to furnish the background of sanity, serenity, and cheerfulness to life, to give moral elasticity to our disposition, to round off the wiry edge of our fretfulness, and make us good-humored and easy of approach. Weakness is too apt to be what the doctors call irritable weakness. And that blessed internal peace and confidence, that acquiescentia in seipso, as Spinoza used to call it, that wells up from every part of the body of a muscularly well-trained human being, and soaks the indwelling soul of him with satisfaction, is, quite apart from every consideration of its mechanical utility, an element of spiritual hygiene of supreme significance.</p>

<p>我几乎确信你都快被这种恐怖的描述吓傻了，而我也一样；我从来不信肌肉会成为废品。即使在未来我们真的再也用不着和残酷的大自然对抗，肌肉力量依旧是必要的。它让我们可以神智健全，从容不迫，对生活充满激情，让我们的生活更富有弹性，不那么急躁，甚至让我们幽默，与人相处融洽。虚弱或许都不应该是那些医生口中的应激性脆弱。那些宝贵的内在平静和自信，Spinoza叫它seipo，会从那些体魄强健的人体内每一个部分喷涌而出，浸润他的灵魂让他心满意足。这与体魄的力学用途根本不一样，所以强健的体魄在心理卫生上非常、极其重要。</p>
